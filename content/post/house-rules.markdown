Not that long ago I was [gearing up][1] to run a Serenity campaign for some friends of mine who are new to tabletop gaming.  After an email discussion about how I like to run games, and what the players were expecting, we organised a time to generate characters.

I sent them blank copies of the character sheet (so that when we sat down at the table they were already familiar with it) and a [3x3x3][2] template for them to fill out.  I asked them to bring concepts for their characters with them, so that they knew what their character was about before we started.

A few days later everyone came around to my house. They had brought their concepts with them, and most had pre-filled the 3x3x3.  "Excellent!" I thought, "They're really getting into this."

There were some awesome character concepts brought to the table, and the 3x3x3's provided some useful background ties I could use to add flavour to the campaign.  Unfortunately (you'll soon see why) one of the players had brought a completed character sheet with him too.

It's at this point I should explain, for those that don't already know, that Serenity uses "Assets <sup id='fnref3'>[1][3]</sup> and Complications <sup id='fnref4'>[2][4]</sup>" to provide not only mechanical advantages, but roleplaying flavour, to the characters.

My friend had included five assets and five complications on his sheet.  I explained that as a house rule, I normally only allow the equivalent of two major (there are also minor) per side of the sheet (assets, and complications).  He proceeded to quote the Core book at me saying that he's keeping his sheet like that because it's in the rules.  I explained my reasoning behind the house rule (even experienced players can find it hard to play that many interlinking assets and complications, it adds a lot to the character; and that I like to leave room for the characters to grow naturally through game play.  By leaving empty slots, the character can gain assets/complications throughout events in the game (think Amputation)).

He still wanted to play with five assets and five complications.  He argued that the character he'd thought up required all of the Assets and Complications and that taking any away would alter the character too much.  Not wanting to upset and possibly make his first tabletop experience a bad one, I relented and allowed him to play with the full sheet.

A week later we met for the first session, which wasn't that great (my fault).  Wanting to give my players a fun session I tried a different approach to a first session, and I think it failed.  But that's another article.

Should I have stuck true to the house rule and had him alter his character?  Should I have told my players of the house rule in the initial email in anticipation of them bringing created characters to the character generation sessions?

What house rules have to had to bend/ignore in order to keep your players happy?  What's your opinion on "but the book says I can"?
