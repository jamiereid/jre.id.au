A couple of friends from work started to get really interested in RC flight, and they bought a couple planes - so I had to get in too :P

After doing a bit of research (and watching a LOT of videos from [FliteTest][]) I ended up purchasing a [plane][] from [Hobbyking][]. It took me a little longer to build then I thought it would, but it was a super enjoyable two afternoons with Jason and his son.

This morning, after waiting for what felt like an eternity, I took my plane down to the oval for it's maiden flight.

I got about 20 seconds flight time before she hit the ground :(  Quite a bit of damage.

I sent photos to Jason, we had a bit of a laugh, and then he said to bring it around (he wanted to borrow my LiPo charger anyway :P). We spent the afternoon charging batteries and repairing my plane.

We found the damage to the propeller section had broken the firewall.

We cut a new one out of an artist's paint palette that Jason had bought for this very purpose and installed it. Good as new!

The other major piece of damage was to the tail section. A bbq skewer and some hot glue later, the tail is nice and sturdy again.

I'm looking forward to getting her back up in air, and hopefully for longer than 20 seconds next time!
